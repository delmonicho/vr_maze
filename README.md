## NYU Tandon VR Assignment 12.1: Create a maze

To create this maze, I started with a VR template from Unity version 2022.19.3.

This gave me a solid base to work around, including examples of interactable objects, environment, teleport kinetics, controller inputs and spatial UI paneling.

I utilized these features to build out the maze according to the rubric specifications.

I added complexity for 2 dead ends as well a final room that unlocks when the user grabs a sphere with the VR controllers and pushes it towards the final door to unlock it.  Once the sphere gets in range of the final door's box collider, the door opens and the user can enter the win state ball pit room and enjoy interacting with the spheres there.
